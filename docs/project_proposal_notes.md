# C472 Project Proposal

## Planetary Rover

A KBS that dictates a rovers navigation based on known geographic features, as well as changes due to perceived environment.

### Problem Solving features of the system:
- Has a known geography based on satellite imagery
- Travels the planet surface to collects pre-determined samples (goals)
- Has sets of rules of how to react to it's environment
- Uses sensors to monitor changes in environment, and it's own condition
- Changes knowledge of known geography from what is perceived during travels
- Additional goals are added based on success or failure of tasks

### Different Systems
- Navigation to samples (shorest path, least cost path, updates to known paths)
- Sensor management (obstical detection, weather monitoring, terrain detection, )
- Rover Resource management (power, weight, condition...)
